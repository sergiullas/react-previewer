# React Previewer

This project is a small demo showing a dashboard with PDF preview panels built using React and Material UI. It uses **react-scripts** so it can be started and built like any Create React App project.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This opens the app in your browser on <http://localhost:3000>.
3. Create a production build
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

The source code now lives in the `src` folder and static assets are under `public`.
